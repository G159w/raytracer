==================================INTRODUCTION=================================

The programm created here consists of a raytracer it's main goal is to create a
picture from a scene described in a file.

The principle behind the raytracer is to create a ray of light using the fact
that a ray of light can always be traveled both ways.
During the process of creating an image each pixel is linked with a ray of light
and we define the color of this light based on it's intersections or reflections
onto objects of the scene.

The basic mapping of pixel is done beforehand and we keep a matrix of pixels to
print at the end of the program.

To check if an object intersects with the ray we need to create functions that
compute the solutions of systems such as the intersection of a plane and a line
or a line and a sphere.

We also need to compute the different lights sources that light up a point.

=====================================USAGE====================================

use 'make' to create a binary file named rt.
"./rt input.in output.ppmi"

you can also use 'make check' to create basic exemple of 3D pictures that will
be create in the 'output' dir at the root of this directory.
