=====================================SPHERES===================================

Spheres can be represented using raytracing and it allows a quite realistic
sphere.

====================================Triangles==================================

Need to implement tirangles. Currently having a triangle in the file does not
show it or shows an uniform screen.
The ipmlementation of triangles is based on planes and smart vector operands
usage. 

==================================Intersection=================================

Intersection is a special type of shape that consists of the two common parts of
2 different shapes for example the intersection of a plane and a sphere is a
circle along with the other composite structures we plan to ipmlement them.

=====================================Union=====================================

Union consists of the union of 2 structures this behaviour is quite similar to
the intersection.

===================================Difference==================================age
of the higer definition pixels:
the difference consists of the difference of 2 structures it allows to
"subtract" shapes to others.

===============================Specular lighting===============================

Specular lighting is the local effect of shine that can be seen onto some
surfaces.
It can be computed along the directional lighting and seen as a filter that is
added on top of the actual picture.

===================================Reflection==================================

Reflection involves recursion from the function that computes the color of a
pixel. thus reflexion can bring a heavy load on some computers.

=================================Phong shading=================================

Phong shading consists of a combination of all the previous lighting methods to
give a more realistic overall look.

=================================Anti aliasing=================================

Due to the the mapping of our pixels we planned to create an anti aliased mask 
We would have implemented a more precise picture and then created pixels making
the average of the higer definition pixels:
